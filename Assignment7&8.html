  <h1>History of Python</h1>
  <p>The programming language Python was conceived in the late 1980s,[1] and its implementation was started in December 1989[2] by Guido van Rossum at CWI in the Netherlands as a successor to ABC capable of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system.[3] Van Rossum is Python's principal author, and his continuing central role in deciding the direction of Python is reflected in the title given to him by the Python community, Benevolent Dictator for Life (BDFL).[4][5] (However, Van Rossum stepped down as leader on July 12, 2018.[6]). Python was named after the BBC TV show Monty Python's Flying Circus.[7]

  <p>Python is a widely-used general-purpose, high-level programming language. It was initially designed by Guido van Rossum in 1991 and developed by Python Software Foundation. It was mainly developed for emphasis on code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code</p>
  <p>Python has come a long way to become the most popular coding language in the world. Python has just turned 30 and just recently at pycon22(python conference) a new feature was released by Anaconda foundation itâ€™s known as pyscript with this now python can be written and run in the browser like javascript which was previously not possible, but it still has that unknown charm & X factor which can be clearly seen from the fact that Google users have consistently searched for Python much more than they have searched for Kim Kardashian, Donald Trump, Tom Cruise, etc. </p>
