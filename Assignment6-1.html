    <h1>History of Java</h1>
    <p>
      The history of Java is very interesting. Java was originally designed for interactive television, but it was 
      too advanced technology for the digital cable television industry at the time. The history of 
      Java starts with the Green Team. Java team members (also known as Green Team),
       initiated this project to develop a language for digital devices such as set-top boxes, 
       televisions, etc. However, it was best suited for internet programming. Later, Java technology was incorporated by Netscape.

      The principles for creating Java programming were 
      "Simple, Robust, Portable, Platform-independent, Secured, High Performance, 
      Multithreaded, Architecture Neutral, Object-Oriented, Interpreted,
       and Dynamic". Java was developed by James Gosling, who is known as the 
       father of Java, in 1995. James Gosling and his team members started the 
      project in the early '90s.
